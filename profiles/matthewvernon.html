    <p>Alright – I guess this is pretty vain, but I thought I’d start this website off by featuring myself. If anything I guess it’ll serve as an introduction into who I am and my motivations behind this little project you’re currently on. It’s also an easy way to test out some questions I’ll use for profiles in the future, even if it seems weird to answer questions I’ve written myself.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-what-are-you-currently-doing-to-make-a-living-where-are-you-based">Who are you, what are you currently doing to make a living, where are you based?</h3>

<p>I am Matthew Vernon, a freelance digital designer from Sydney, Australia. I spent the bulk of my days working out of my bedroom for a range of startups – usually on web design projects. I also love to work on side projects and my own ideas in my free time – this site is one of them. Another main side project of mine is <a href="http://neuegoods.com">Neue Goods</a> – a clothing label I have been running for almost two years.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-freelancing">How long have you been freelancing?</h3>

<p>I have been working on freelance projects for almost as long as I have been a designer. One of my first real projects was to design a printed flyer for a local cleaning company. I charged $50. I continued to take on projects all throughout design school – and during my first full time positions. I officially left to freelance on a full time basis in February of 2016.</p>

<h3 id="did-you-ever-work-as-a-designer-in-a-full-time-role">Did you ever work as a designer in a full time role?</h3>

<p>Yes, I had two full time positions – one at a tech startup and one at a digital agency. I always had ambitions to work for myself, freelance or start a company of sorts, but after graduation I still felt like there was a lot more for me to learn, and room for me to grow as a designer. Although I would’ve loved to freelance straight out of school, I just didn’t have the skills or know-how to make it work. I figured getting some experience in some full time roles would be a great way for me to learn the ins and outs of the industry, and possibly receive some mentorship before jumping in to freelance.</p>

<p>Funnily enough – this wasn’t the case, as I was thrown right into the deep end in both positions, with very little help or mentorship. I had to learn things out for myself through experience. This was actually great, because I felt like I progressed as a designer much quicker than other people. I went from fresh out of design school, into a somewhat ‘mid-weight’ role almost immediately. It also showed me first hand that no one actually knows what they’re doing. Everyone is winging it. With this experience, I figured I had just as much chance at making it work as anyone else.</p>

<h3 id="what-motivated-you-to-make-the-jump-into-freelancing">What motivated you to make the jump into freelancing?</h3>

<p>From a very young age I have always wanted to have a sense of independence. I have always admired people who have been able to make a living from something they love and enjoy, and aimed to some day reach that point. It’s a bit left of field – but when I was a teenager I was very interested in punk, hardcore, skateboarding and all the other shit that comes along with being a ratchet kid from the suburbs. I looked up to people that went against the grain of society and I believe these subcultures have very much instilled a sense of ideals that is still present in me today. I may not be a pro skateboarder, or touring the world in a hardcore band – but I believe working for myself is a pretty good compromise.</p>

<h3 id="was-it-a-conscious-decision--or-was-it-something-you-fell-into">Was it a conscious decision – or was it something you fell into?</h3>

<p>Yes and no. Yes – in that I had always planned to go freelance, but also no because the opportunity to actually quit full time work kind of just fell into my lap. I was working at an agency, and had been in talks with potentially working with the dudes at <a href="http://madetogether.com.au">Made Together</a>, another studio here in Sydney. I told them I was really keen to freelance one day, and they said they’d be open to facilitating that process for me by letting me work for them a few days a week. I had a holiday to Japan lined up, so I figured – fuck it. I’ll quit my job, head off to Japan, come back unemployed, work with these dudes for a few days a week and try to win some of my own clients on the side. If it didn’t work, I could always just find another job.</p>

<p>Of course – things didn’t go as planned. Made Together were still in the process of securing some new clients when I returned from Japan, so they weren’t ready for me to start working yet. I didn’t have much money saved – so I had to find clients fast. This ended up working well, as it threw me in the deep end and I was forced to make it work.</p>

<em>My Current Desk Setup</em></p>

<h3 id="prior-to-leaving-full-time-work-what-steps-did-you-put-in-place-to-prepare-yourself-for-freelancing">Prior to leaving full time work, what steps did you put in place to prepare yourself for freelancing?</h3>

<p>I don’t think I put much preparation into making the leap at all. I didn’t have a lot of money saved up, I didn’t have clients or projects lined up and I didn’t know a lot about running a legit freelance business.</p>

<p>But now that I look back on it, it was definitely something that was years in the making. All the work I had been putting in prior to leaving – like my side projects, my website/portfolio, and my previous freelance experience really provided a nice foundation for me to launch into full-time freelance from.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-secure-your-first-freelance-client">How did you secure your first freelance client?</h3>

<p>A lot of my first projects weren’t actually independent projects with my own clients – they were temporary in-house roles at design studios and startups. For the first 6 or so months of freelancing, I would be jumping between studios and startups doing 2 days here, 3 days there.. charging each studio a day rate.</p>

<p>The agency I worked at full time needed some help after I had quit, so I came back in as a freelancer for a few weeks. The other roles I had found online ads for, or were found via word of mouth.</p>

<p>It actually took a while for me to secure my first few real, independent clients. There were a few projects I got from random emails from people who had heard about me from friends, but another way I secured a lot of work was from Facebook Groups. I’m a member of a Facebook group that contains people from the Sydney startup community. It’s full of developers, engineers, growth hackers and people running their own startups – which means, there’s a lot of people that need to hire designers. Every couple of months I put up a post with portfolio and I’ll usually receive a few clients from it.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-charge-clients">How do you charge clients?</h3>

<p>For agencies, startups and ongoing projects – I’ll charge a day rate. At the moment my day rate is somewhere between $400–$700/day. To calculate this, I doubled what I was earning full-time (to account for expenses, tax and super) and then whacked some more on top to account for periods where I am without work. I’ll charge clients less if they can guarantee work for an extended period of time, and I’ll also add on a “dickhead fee” for shit clients who I do not enjoy working with.</p>

<p>For independent projects with a scope – I’ll provide a flat rate quote. I usually work this out by estimating how many days I’ll need to spend on it, and then multiplying that by my day rate to calculate how much I should charge.</p>
