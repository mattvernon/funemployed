If anything I guess it’ll serve as an introduction into who I am and my motivations behind this little project you’re currently on. Here we go..</h1>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction?</h3>

<p>I am Matthew Vernon – a designer from Sydney, Australia. I’m currently freelancing out of my bedroom, working for clients on a wide range of projects. I design websites, create strategies, develop brands and also write a bit of code. In between projects I like to make and build my own projects, with an aim of one day eliminating client work all together.</p>

<h3 id="how-this-all-got-started">How this all got started</h3>

<p>I have been working on freelance projects for almost as long as I have been a designer. One of my first real projects was working on the design of a printed flyer for a local cleaning company back when I was in my first year of design school. I charged $50. I continued to take on projects all throughout design school – and also during my first full time positions, but I officially left to freelance on a full time basis in February of 2016.</p>

<p>Before freelancing I had two full time positions – one at a tech startup and one at a digital agency. I always had ambitions to work for myself, freelance or start a company of sorts. But after graduation I still felt like there was a lot more for me to learn, and room for me to grow as a designer. So I figured getting some experience in some full time roles would be a great way for me to learn the ins and outs of the industry, and possibly receive some mentorship before jumping in to freelance.</p>

<p>Funnily enough – this wasn’t the case, as I was thrown right into the deep end in both positions, with very little help or mentorship. I had to learn things out for myself through experience. This was actually great, because I felt like I progressed as a designer much quicker than other people. I went from fresh out of design school, into a somewhat ‘mid-weight’ role almost immediately. These positions did teach me a lot about business though. They were both pretty small operations so I saw the ins and outs behind both businesses. The most important thing I learn from this is that absolutely no one has it together, everyone is learning, and everyone is making it up as they go.</p>

<h3 id="why-freelance">Why freelance?</h3>

<p>From a very young age I have always wanted to have a sense of independence. I have always admired people who have been able to make a living from something they love and enjoy, and aimed to some day reach that point. It’s a bit left of field – but when I was a teenager I was very interested in punk, hardcore, skateboarding and the DIY aspect behind these communities. I looked up to people that went against the grain of society and I believe these subcultures have instilled a sense of ideals that is still present within in me today. I may not be a pro skateboarder, or touring the world in a hardcore band – but I believe being my own boss and pitching for new work in a dirty Black Flag t–shirt is a good enough compromise.</p>

<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>

<p>I don’t think I put much preparation making the leap at all. I didn’t have a lot of money saved up, I didn’t have clients or projects lined up and I didn’t know a lot about running a real business.</p>

<p>I was getting itchy feet in my full time job and was looking to make a move – another agency reached out and said they’d be happy facilitating my move into freelance by hooking me up with a 3 day / week contract position – so I took the offer and made the jump.</p>

<p>Now that I look back on it I kind of fell into freelance and had it pretty good, but it was definitely something that was years in the making. All the work I had been putting in prior to leaving – like my side projects, my website/portfolio, and my previous freelance experience really provided a nice foundation for me to launch into full-time freelance from.</p>

<h3 id="getting-clients-and-projects">Getting clients and projects</h3>

<p>A lot of my first projects weren’t actually independent projects with my own clients – they were contract roles at design studios and startups. For the first 6 or so months of freelancing, I would be bouncing around between studios and startups (and the agency I worked at full time) doing 2 days here, 3 days there.. charging each studio a day rate.</p>

<p>It actually took a while for me to secure my first few real, independent clients. There were a few projects I got from random emails from people who had heard about me from friends, but another way I secured a lot of work was from Facebook Groups. I’m a member of a Facebook group that contains people from the Sydney startup community. It’s full of developers, engineers, growth hackers and people running their own startups – which means, there’s a lot of people that need to hire designers. Every couple of months I put up a post with portfolio and I’ll usually receive a few clients from it.</p>

<h3 id="cashin-cheques">Cashin’ cheques</h3>

<p>For agencies, startups and ongoing projects – I’ll charge a day rate. To calculate this, I doubled what I was earning full-time (to account for expenses, tax and super) and then whacked some more on top to account for periods where I am without work. I’ll charge clients less if they can guarantee work for an extended period of time, and I’ll also add on a “dickhead fee” for clients who I do not enjoy working with.</p>

<p>For independent projects with a scope – I’ll provide a flat rate quote. I usually work this out by estimating how many days I’ll need to spend on it, and then multiplying that by my day rate to calculate how much I should charge.</p>

<h3 id="side-projects">Side projects</h3>

<p>I have a few side-hustles that bring in a bit of cash.</p>

<p>I run a clothing label for design nerds called Neue Goods. It makes money – but not a lot. I’m constantly funnelling it back into the business. So right now I haven’t made a profit. Clothing labels are hard work and require a tonne of brand building. It’s definitely a slowburn.</p>

<p>Last year I wrote an ebook called <a href="http://sketchandsemplice.com">Sketch + Semplice</a>, its a how-to guide for designers who want to learn how to build completely custom website with <a href="http://sketchapp.com">Sketch</a>, and <a href="http://semplice.com">Semplice</a>. It took me ages to write – and when I launched it I got about 30 orders in the first week. That was a nice little nugget of extra cash, but was kind of nothing when I thought about how much work I put into it. Since then it’s kind of become a “passive income” thing, as I’ll still get a few random orders coming in. Maybe 2 or 3 a month. Nothing to rave about though.</p>

<p>I’m also really into investing in Cryptocurrency at the moment. I bought up a fair amount of Ethereum before it boomed, so that’s left me with a nice little nest egg to sit on. I really believe in the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology – so I haven’t sold any yet. Because of that – I don’t really count it as money as it’s all hypothetical until your investment is realised. I continue buying up small amounts of both Bitcoin and Ethereum each week.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>I don’t see myself going back to full time work any time soon. My main aim is to really solidify my freelance business – it’s still a bit shakey at the moment. There are periods of time where I’m without work and I start running out of money, which is definitely something I want to address moving forward. I feel like I still haven’t hit the sweet spot yet.</p>

<p>I’m also really focussing on learning how to code more. I’m really happy that I’ve been able to learn how to code up websites (like the one you’re reading now) – but I’m even more interested in learning how to develop web apps that can do things. I have a tonne of ideas and need to put them into action. I’m really inspired by makers like <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge">Marc Köhlbrugge</a>, <a href="https://haydenbleasel.com/">Hayden Bleasel</a> and <a href="jeremyblaze.com">Jeremy Blaze</a> who make their own digital products that look insanely good, work well and also make them money.</p>

<p>I hang out with my mate <a href="http://instagram.com/michlbrnt">Michael Brunt</a> a fair bit. We’ve collaborated on some projects and are always talking about creating a studio. So hey – that could also be a thing that happens.</p>

<p>I’m interested in opening up a lot more about how I work, and the projects I manage. I would like to explore different ways to showcase my work – like live streaming my process on Twitch, and documenting projects through little vlogs on YouTube. Even if no one watches, at least it’s a new avenue to work in.</p>
